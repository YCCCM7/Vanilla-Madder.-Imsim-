Care should be taken to heal such injuries as quickly as possible or death may result.|n|nLight Wounds: Slightly decreased accuracy.|nMedium Wounds: Wavering vision.|nHeavy Wounds: Death."
HealthPartDesc[1]="The torso is by far the portion of the human anatomy able to absorb the most damage, but it is also the easiest to target in close quarters combat.

HealthPartDesc[2]="Obviously damage to the arm is of concern in any combat situation as it has a direct effect on the agent's ability to utilize a variety of weapons. Losing the use of one arm will certainly lower the agent's combat efficiency, while the loss of both arms will render it nearly impossible for an agent to present even a nominal threat to most hostiles. Of course, for one-handed weapons, only the arm actively holding the weapon is of concern.|n|nLight Wounds: Slightly decreased accuracy.|nMedium Wounds: Moderately decreased accuracy.|nMajor Wounds: Significantly decreased accuracy."
HealthPartDesc[3]="Injuries to the leg will result in drastically diminished mobility. If an agent in hostile territory is unfortunate enough to lose the use of both legs but still remain otherwise viable, they are ordered to execute UNATCO Special Operations Order 99009 (Self-Termination).|n|nLight Wounds: Slightly impaired movement.|nMedium Wounds: Moderately impaired movement.|nHeavy Wounds: Significantly impaired movement."

PresetDescs[15]="STEM is fused into your very essence. While most agents might operate alone, or with another human, you find camaraderie in pure steel.

PresetDescsNoCrafting[0]="You will define your own resonations, skills, and talents in the menus to come."
PresetDescsNoCrafting[1]="Weapon handling and customization come easy, at least in the form of pistols and rifles. However, you lean towards rifles and the standard issue 10mm. You know enough medicine to patch yourself up, and you're fit enough to traverse bodies of water.|n|nSkills: Weapons: Pistol(1), Weapons: Rifle(1), Medicine(1), Fitness(1)|nTalents: Pistol Focus, Pistol Modularity, Rifle Focus, Rifle Modularity"
PresetDescsNoCrafting[2]="Emplaced mines gives you the ability to plan for the 'later', and your proficiency with heavy weapons gives you the ability to plan for the 'now'.

PresetDescsNoCrafting[3]="Doors absolutely hate you. Handy with a crowbar, and half as handy with a lockpick, you keep a low presence, with the potential to kill off the occassional straggler. You aren't built for robust combat, but that won't matter long term.|n|nSkills: Weapons: Low Tech(1), Infiltration(2)|nTalents: Silent Takedown, Soft Spot, Brute Force, Coverup, Keen Instincts, Pickpocket"
PresetDescsNoCrafting[4]="Infiltration, hardware, and software... What more need be said? You can also pickpocket, and your ability to bypass obstacles often goes unnoticed.|n|nSkills: Infiltration(2), Hardware(1), Software(1)|nTalents: Keen Instincts, Sleight of Hand, Silent Mode, Invader's Kit"
PresetDescsNoCrafting[5]="The digital realm has always spoken to you. While okay enough with a multitool, you really shine behind a keyboard, with a suite of software ready to go. You can bypass alarm units and keypads quite well, to your credit, and aren't half bad with a magnum.|n|nSkills: Hardware(1), Software(2), Weapons: Pistol(1)|nTalents: Data Analyst, Wave Surfer, Wiz Kid, IFF Programming"
PresetDescsNoCrafting[6]="Your job isn't to fling lead or pick a lock. Your job is to swoop in, turn systems against your enemies, and slip out unnoticed.

PresetDescsNoCrafting[7]="You're good at bypassing obstacles on foot, but are prepared to take a couple hits with a flak jacket. You're respectable with a lockpick and multitool, too, so you can tackle all forms of obstacles that come your way.|n|nSkills: Fitness(1), Tactical Gear(2), Infiltration(1), Hardware(1)|nTalents: Fit As a Fiddle, Off Switch, Gentle Touch, Insulation"
PresetDescsNoCrafting[8]="You can reduce damage coming your way, and patch up any hits you DO end up taking.

PresetDescsNoCrafting[9]="You move fast first, but shoot second. Rolling about the battlefield, and tuning your guns to peak condition, you're swift, and you're effective.

PresetDescsNoCrafting[10]="You know a bit of everything relevant to the art of distributing death.

PresetDescsNoCrafting[11]="Your use of a rifle is respectable, but focuses on finesse instead of raw ease. You're quite used to wearing a vest to work, and you're alright around a blade as well. Where you go, death follows.|n|nSkills: Tactical Gear(2), Weapons: Rifle(1), Weapons: Low Tech(1)|nTalents: Rifle Modularity, Followup Shot, Off Switch, Gentle Touch, Insulation"
PresetDescsNoCrafting[12]="You're not here to fight. You trust in your ingenuity too much to focus on bypassing things. However, you're still the most agile there's ever been, you can patch up the ocassional hit you take, and you can hack a computer in a pinch.|n|nSkills: Fitness(3), Medicine(1), Software(1)|nTalents: Aquadynamic, Deep, Steady, Tactical Roll, Fall Roll, Trained Professional"
PresetDescsNoCrafting[13]="You're not here to fight, per se.

Description="A standard hazardous materials suit that protects against a full range of environmental hazards including radiation, fire, biochemical toxins, electricity, and EMP. Hazmat suits contain an integrated bacterial oxygen scrubber that degrades over time and thus should not be reused. At base, a hazmat suit reduces poison gas and radiation by 50%, and other hazards by 25%, but grants full immunity to blinding aerosols. Any user's skill fitting the suit, however, has a strong influence on its lifetime and effectiveness."

Tips[0]="In VMD, you will (by default) consume hunger over time. This is disabled in training, but observe the 'HU' meter on your HUD, near energy. Without food, you will slowly perish. Some foods replenish more than others, and some have potential side effects."
Tips[1]="Whoops. I almost forgot to mention, but you can configure many of the features mentioned in your little reality breaks you're having. Find them in the Main Menu > Settings > VMD Options window. Cheers."
Tips[2]="Melee weapons can be used underwater, without exception. The knife can be used to eat dead animals should you run low on food, and works well underwater. Touching or whacking mobile pieces of terrain will give more intel on them."
Tips[3]="Notice how you have to 'scout' this door during your first encounter. Multitool and lockpick usage can both be rushed by double-clicking the object when bypassing. However, this will generate noise if the item is not bypassed by the tool's destruction."
Tips[4]="Multitools work the same way as lockpicks. However, (by default) using a tool on a keypad will reveal characters you can recombine to crack a combination. If you get tired of this, just double click with a tool to hack it."
Tips[5]="What a buzzkill, right friend-of-mine?"
Tips[6]="Totally KO'd. Carrying bodies can act as a slight piece of cover when under fire... But KO'd people will die from being bullet sponges. Carrying dead bodies (by default) generates a blood smell your enemies can detect. Murder is bad, you know."
Tips[7]="Objects hidden in the dark will not unveil their selection box, unless otherwise poked or bumped into. The dark is not your friend, friend."
Tips[8]="Repair and medical bots have limited charges with which to distribute resupplying. However, this is not the case in hub areas or otherwise peaceful zones, so don't be too afraid to use them."
Tips[9]="Some sources of ammunition will be swapped out when visiting otherwise normal maps. These gas cap rounds are such an example of a new, hidden ammo type."
Tips[10]="I know stacking boxes is sometimes tiring, friend. When configuring skill talents on a character, you can find 'fit as a fiddle' in the fitness tree to acquire a mean jump duck. If you really hate stacking boxes, it's not a bad investment."
Tips[11]="You might be getting just a hair hungry by now. Check the righthand meter labeled 'HU'. A quick bite of a candybar can cover about a quarter of your hunger bar."
Tips[12]="Taking damage (by default) is one of the factors that feed into stress. The 'AX' bar represents anxiety levels. Charged pickups that reduce damage now only corrode very little when not taking damage. Taking damage underwater makes you lose air. Chin up!"
Tips[13]="I mentioned these earlier. Dunno if you were paying attention. In VMD, bullets ricochet at shallow angles but penetrate at steep angles. Gas caps disperse gas, as just one example, when ricocheting about. Try it out by switching ammos! (Apostrophe key, by default)"
Tips[14]="Aim focus rates are more generous at higher skill levels, adding quality of life to using guns. Aim bloom, however, removes aim focus when firing. In VMD, strengths are buffed, but weaknesses are amplified all the same."
Tips[15]="Ducking gives an additive bonus to your current accuracy. Accuracy caps off at a certain point, however. Guns will also dirty after being fired extensively. Press your reload key after a jam or when your mag is full to begin cleaning. Click to interrupt."
Tips[16]="HVAP is another new ammo type you can find. For contrast, these rounds specialize in bullet penetration and anti-armor effect, but negate silencers, to put it mildly. Try shooting a deployed target through the concrete divider, if you want."
Tips[17]="Remember that thing about strengths and weaknesses? Sorry, friend. While throwing grenades is free, placing grenades as mines requires a talent. This time it's free, but check your skills screen later. We're in this (and your head, LOL) together!"
Tips[18]="Defusing grenades is punished more at lower skill levels. You don't have any skills, so just try to get out of this one in one piece, friendo!"
Tips[19]="While often blinding to the eyes, tech goggles have been overhauled in VMD. Now they act as short range infrared sensors. Use them during stealth to find enemy positions from safe cover."
Tips[20]="Blood and food can both generate smells if exposed to in excess. A talent from lockpicking (infiltration) can push this threshold back, but washing off (or not killing) and bringing the right configuration of food can eliminate the problem entirely."
Tips[21]="Locate the nearby multitool, and try codebreaking out for real this time. Or just double-click it if you get impatient."
Tips[22]="A knife should be nearby. This brick is no longer revealed by default, but you can try poking it, or stabbing it to reveal its position. Same with the wall it opens."
Tips[23]="'Barrier', 'Unknown', 'Locked'... There are many labels you may find doors reveal themselves as. Don't bother poking anything that isn't locked or unlocked when revealed. That means they can't be opened by hand. Look for other means nearby."
Tips[24]="All bypassing is slightly random, but is randomized on new game start. Using an entire tool generates noise, but steering off of your target will negate this effect, at the cost of less potency, and a small cooldown. Speed or stealth? You can't have both."
